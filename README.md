This repository contains the following projects:

## 1. Iris Flower Classification

**Description**: This project is focused on building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica, based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

- **Objective**: To create a predictive model that accurately classifies the species of iris flowers based on their measurements.
- **Dataset**: The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- **Methodology**: The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and training various classification models.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Outcome**: The model achieved an accuracy of over 95% using the Support Vector Machine classifier.

## 2. Car Price Prediction

**Description**: This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features such as age, mileage, fuel type, and transmission.

- **Objective**: To develop a regression model that provides accurate car price predictions based on historical data.
- **Dataset**: The dataset comprises information about various used cars, including their age, mileage, make, model, fuel type, transmission, and selling price.
- **Methodology**: The project includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Lasso Regressor).
- **Tools Used**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Outcome**: The Random Forest Regressor model performed the best, with an R-squared value of 0.90, indicating a strong predictive performance.

## 3. Unemployment Analysis

**Description**: This project involves analyzing unemployment rates across different regions and demographics to identify trends, patterns, and correlations.

- **Objective**: To perform a comprehensive analysis of unemployment data to understand the factors influencing unemployment rates and how they vary across different regions and demographics.
- **Dataset**: The dataset includes historical unemployment data segmented by region, age group, gender, and education level.
- **Methodology**: The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and visualization of trends and patterns in the unemployment data.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Outcome**: The analysis revealed significant insights into how unemployment rates are influenced by factors such as education level and region. Visualizations helped to highlight key trends and patterns, providing a deeper understanding of unemployment dynamics.
